# RegexFromScratch
Implementing regex in a fast way using NFA's and Thompsons construction.
Code based on the slides from [Sedgewicks Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/keynote/54RegularExpressions.pdf).
Using NFA's makes recognizing regexs incredibly fast with the tradeoff of losing a lot of modern regex features (which arent proper regular expressions in the first place).

# Possible Extensions:

- [x] Add multiway or.
- [ ] Handle metacharacters.
- [ ] Support character classes.
- [ ] Add capturing capabilities.
- [ ] Extend the closure operator.
- [ ] Error checking and recovery.
- [ ] Greedy vs. reluctant matching.
