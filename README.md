# RegexFromScratch
Implementing regex in a fast way using NFA's and Thompsons construction.
Code based on the slides from [Sedgewicks Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/lectures/keynote/54RegularExpressions.pdf).
Using NFA's makes recognizing regexs incredibly fast with the tradeoff of losing a lot of modern regex features (which arent proper regular expressions in the first place).
I have exteneded the language to have a multiway "|" (or)  and will work on other simple extensions.
